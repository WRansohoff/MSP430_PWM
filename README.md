Two simple PWM examples using the MSP430. `basic_pwm` dims and brightens an LED connected to P1.6, and `hello_pwm` dims and brightens a common-cathode RGB LED through different colors using P1.6, P2.1, and P2.5. The `hello_pwm` example also demonstrates how to continue cycling the LEDs after turning the CPU off.
